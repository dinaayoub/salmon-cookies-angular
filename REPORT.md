# JS Framework Comparative Analysis

## Framework Name: Angular

### Research Conducted By: Tina Myers, Sowmya Billakanti, Dina Ayoub, Ricardo Barcenas

### Overall Score and Comments
#### Score (Out of 10): 
#### General Comments

Stack is front-end only that is able to be run on mobile as well as web apps. Works with single page apps, and custom tags can be created.
<!-- Describe the stack (front-end only? full stack?), database, efficiency, etc. Describe the general usability and learnability -->

#### Pros
* Works for mobile and web based apps
* Relatively simple to use for refactoring code, as HTML is able to be brought in with tags

#### Cons
* Extensive set up and overwhelming file tree
* Steep learning curve, as it relies on typescript (similar to JS, but much more strongly typed)

### Ratings and Reviews

#### Systems Requirements

Can use CORS to connect to back-end which includes the database, but as Angular is front-end, it has no database
Can be deployed to several hosting sites, though downloading the package is required to do so. See image: [IMG](./src/assets/deploy.jpg)
<!-- Above and beyond 'node' and 'linux', what dependencies or core requirements exist for this framework?  Can it play at AWS/Heroku?  Does it require a certain database? -->

#### Ramp-Up Projections
<!-- How long would/should it take a team of mid-junior developers to become productive? -->
For a basic app, it would not take long to become productive if the team could wrap their minds around typescript. If typescript were a barrier, it may take a week or two to get comfortable enough with Angular to make a fully functional semi-complex app.

#### Community Support and Adoption levels

<!-- How popular is this framework? What big companies are running on it? How is it "seen" in the general JS community?  Is there an active community of developers supporting and growing it? -->
